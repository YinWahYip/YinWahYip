### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent Computer Science Major at Villanova University. Born in Hong Kong, living in China, now pursuing my future in the U.S., my experiences in these worlds have provided me a unique outlook on questions of domestic and global questions. Immersion in both the familiar and unfamiliar keeps me open to seeking out new experiences, pushing me to learn from opportunities and and mistakes alike. 
I'm open to any opportunities! Feel free to reach out at yyip@villanova.edu.
